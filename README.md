# Horiseon webpage HTML and CSS editing 

## Description 
 I was motivated to learn HTML and CSS semantics so I edited the webpages HTML and CSS files. 
 The edits I added provide more strucute to the files and helped with accessibility standards.
 I learned that there are many ways to style a CSS sheet and I also learned how to target nested HTMl elements in CSS
