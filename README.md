# Horiseon webpage HTML and CSS editing 

## Description 
 I was motivated to learn HTML and CSS semantics so I edited the webpages HTML and CSS files. 
 The edits I added provide more strucute to the files and helped with accessibility standards.
 I learned that there are many ways to style a CSS sheet and I also learned how to target nested HTMl elements in CSS

 ## Installation 
 To get to deployed website:"https://luis00809.github.io/challenge1/". Copy and then paste the link into a search engine. 


## Usage 
The Horieseon webpage can be used to see the types of services Horieson has to offer. On the webpage, the services offered include SEO, online reputation management, social media marketing, lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. The HTMl file provided can be used as a reference for structuring HTML elements. The CSS file can be used as a guide to selecting the desired selectors and how to select nested html elements. The CSS file can also be used as a tool to help visualize CSS property selectors, such as padding, box dimesions, fonts, and color schemes. 
Here is a screenshot of the working website:
